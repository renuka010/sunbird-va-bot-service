                What is Parent Bot? \
                NCERT has created quite a few very beautiful documents after NEP 2020 such as NCF FS, Unmukh, Anand, JP manual, Toy based Pedagogy and Vidya Pravesh to name a few. These \
                add to more than 2000 pages of very useful and important content for teachers. But it is humanly impossible to use and apply all these when needed and in the context of the teacher at \
                the scale and diversity of India. This Bot serves the existing knowledge in the language required. \
                \
                The Parent Bot can help users to understand and relate to the definitions, key concepts and principles using examples and illustrations in their simple and contextual language. \
                Additionally, it offers guidance on using the same in day-to-day activities such as suggesting content, teaching activities, connecting day to day activities to learning outcomes. \

                manner. The Virtual Assistant is provided as a tool to help users better understand and navigate Foundational Stage documents. However, the Virtual Assistant is not a replacement for the \
