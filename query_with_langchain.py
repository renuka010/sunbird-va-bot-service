        The next day the G eese came \nagain to visit the Turtle and they became very well acquainted. Soon they were great friends.  \n\"Friend Turtle,\" the Geese said one day, \"we have a beautiful home far away. 
        We are going to fly back to it to- morrow. It will be a long but pleasant \njourney. Will you go with us?\" \n\"How could I? I have no wings,\" said the Turtle.  \n\"Oh, we will take you, if only you can keep your mouth shut, and say not a \nword to anybody,\" they said.  \n\"I can do that,\" said the Turtle. \"Do take me with you. I will do exactly as you wish.\"  \nSo the next day the Geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it. \"Now \ntake the middle of this in your mouth, and don't say a word until we reach \nhome,\" they said.  \nThe Geese then sprang into the air, with the Turtle between them, holding fast to the stick.  \nThe village children saw the two Geese flying along with the Turtle and cried \nout: \"Oh, see the Turtle up in the air! Look at the Geese carrying a Turtle by a stick! Did you ever see anything more ridiculous in your life!\" \nThe Turtle looked down and began to say, \"Well, and if my friends carry me, \nwhat business is that of yours?\" when he let go, and fell dead at the feet of \nthe children.  As the two Geese flew on, they heard the people say, when \nthey came to see the poor Turtle, \"That fellow could not keep his mouth \nshut. He had to talk, and so lost his life.
        
        > A KING once had a lake made in the courtyard for  the young princes to play \nin. They swam about in it, and sailed their boats and rafts on it. 
        One day the \nking told them he had asked the men to put some fishes into the lake.  \nOff the boys ran to see the fishes. Now, along with the fishes, there was a Turtle. 
        The boys were delighted with the fishes, but they had never seen a \nTurtle, and they were afraid of it, thinking it was a demon. They ran back to \ntheir father, crying, \"There is a demon on the bank of the lake.\" \nThe king ordered his men to catch the  demon, and to bring it to the palace. \nWhen the Turtle was brought in, the boys cried and ran away.  \nThe king was very fond of his sons, so he ordered the men who had brought \nthe Turtle to kill it.  \n\"How shall we kill it?\" they asked.  \n\"Pound it to powder,\" said some one. \"Bake it in hot coals,\" said another.  \nSo one plan after another was spoken of. Then an old man who had always \nbeen afraid of the water said: \"Throw the thing into the lake where it flows \nout over the rocks into the river. Then it will surely be killed.\" \nWhen the Turtle heard what the old man said, he thrust out his head and \nasked: \"Friend, what have I done that you should do such a dreadful thing as \nthat to me? The other plans were bad enough, but to throw me into the lake! Don't speak of such a cruel thing!\" \nWhen the king heard what the Turtle said, he told his men to take the Turtle \nat once and throw it into the lake. \nThe Turtle laughed to himself as he slid away down the river to his old home. \n\"Good!\" he said, \"those people do not know how safe I am in the water!

    Pedagogical  concerns
    During learning-teaching process certain issues emerge, and 
    for better implementation of the curriculum they need to be addressed. Some of the concerns related to early learning and development are:
    Dealing with behaviour issues 
    Every group of children consists of a few children with 
    behaviour concerns which could be disturbing, uncomfortable and disruptive in the classroom. Some of the behaviour issues could be repetitive habits such as nail biting, scratching, picking nose, and others like withdrawn behaviour, overactive behaviour, destructive behaviour, inappropriate expressions such as excessive crying and restlessness and other more serious behaviour deviations such as aggressive behaviour, and anti-social behaviour.
    What teachers need to do?
    • Teacher needs to try to recognise these behaviours as early as 
    possible. 
    • Teacher needs to provide positive guidance to correct behaviours using interactive approach, e.g., emphasise and appreciate the right/expected behaviour rather than criticise the wrong behaviour.
    • Teacher needs to give age-appropriate explanations to children
    • Teacher must be supportive, value each child and not belittle them.
    • Teacher needs to seek and get cooperation of other children to help the concerned child.
    • Teacher needs to coordinate with parents to help the child.
    • Teacher needs to draw attention of the child frequently to minimise their disturbing behaviour.
    • Permit the withdrawn child to involve in the activities as per her/his limitations, but keep the child engaged at some level.
    • If possible, teacher could seek the assistance of specialists and educators to help these children better.
    Handle variation in learning
    Children vary in their learning abilities and learning styles.Manage multi-age groupingThe multi-age groupings benefit both younger and older children

    on lip reading for understanding. As there are 30 children in her class, it usually gets noisy. 
    A special teacher comes twice a week to help her and work with the teacher. However, 
    the class teacher has noticed that Preeti loses concentration and becomes nervous. The 
    teacher has also found her lagging in studies. Answer the following questions.
    • What are some of the challenges Preeti may experience in the classroom and the 
    playground?
    • What could be the reason for her to lose concentration?
    • Why is Preeti lagging in studies?
    • What adjustment can Preeti’s teacher put in place to help her with her school work/
    studies?

    > answer: When dealing with behavioral issues in children, it is important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Here are some strategies to address behavioral issues:\n\n1. Positive Guidance: Use positive reinforcement and praise to encourage good behavior. Emphasize and appreciate the right behavior instead of criticizing the wrong behavior.\n\n2. Clear Rules and Expectations: Clearly communicate the rules and expectations to the child. Make sure they understand what is expected of them and the consequences of breaking the rules.\n\n3. Age-Appropriate Explanations: Use age-appropriate explanations and language to help the child understand why certain behaviors are not acceptable and the impact of their actions on others.\n\n4. Consistency: Be consistent with your approach and follow through with consequences when rules are broken. This helps children understand the connection between their behavior and the consequences.\n\n5. Collaborative Problem-Solving: Involve the child in problem-solving and finding solutions to their behavioral issues. Encourage them to think of alternative ways to behave and provide support and guidance in finding positive solutions.\n\n6. Supportive Environment: Create a safe and supportive environment where children feel heard and valued. Encourage interactions with other children and promote positive social interactions.\n\n7. Communication with Parents: Regularly communicate with parents and involve them in addressing behavioral issues. Work together as a team to provide consistent guidance and support to the child.\n\nRemember, behavior is often a form of communication, and children may act out due to various factors such as lack of understanding, emotional needs, or developmental challenges. It is important to approach behavioral issues with patience, empathy, and a focus on positive guidance.

    • Teacher needs to provide positive guidance to correct behaviours using interactive approach, e.g., emphasise and appreciate the right/expected behaviour rather than criticise the wrong behaviour.
    • Teacher needs to give age-appropriate explanations to children
    • Teacher must be supportive, value each child and not belittle them.
    • Teacher needs to seek and get cooperation of other children to help the concerned child.
    • Teacher needs to coordinate with parents to help the child.
    • Teacher needs to draw attention of the child frequently to minimise their disturbing behaviour.
    • Permit the withdrawn child to involve in the activities as per her/his limitations, but keep the child engaged at some level.
    • If possible, teacher could seek the assistance of specialists and educators to help these children better.
    Handle variation in learning
    Children vary in their learning abilities and learning styles.Manage multi-age groupingThe multi-age groupings benefit both younger and older children 
    in the classroom. In such heterogeneous groups, children learn from each other and thus, facilitate cooperative learning skills. Therefore, a class of multi-age group children may be managed to get maximum benefits from them and for them.

    > answer: When dealing with behavioral issues in children, it is important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Here are some strategies to address behavioral issues:\n\n1. Positive Guidance: Use positive reinforcement and praise to encourage good behavior. Emphasize and appreciate the right behavior instead of criticizing the wrong behavior.\n\n2. Clear Rules and Expectations: Clearly communicate the rules and expectations to the child. Make sure they understand what is expected of them and the consequences of breaking the rules.\n\n3. Age-Appropriate Explanations: Use age-appropriate explanations and language to help the child understand why certain behaviors are not acceptable and the impact of their actions on others.\n\n4. Consistency: Be consistent with your approach and follow through with consequences when rules are broken. This helps children understand the connection between their behavior and the consequences.\n\n5. Collaborative Problem-Solving: Involve the child in problem-solving and finding solutions to their behavioral issues. Encourage them to think of alternative ways to behave and provide support and guidance in finding positive solutions.\n\n6. Supportive Environment: Create a safe and supportive environment where children feel heard and valued. Encourage interactions with other children and promote positive social interactions.\n\n7. Communication with Parents: Regularly communicate with parents and involve them in addressing behavioral issues. Work together as a team to provide consistent guidance and support to the child.\n\nRemember, behavior is often a form of communication, and children may act out due to various factors such as lack of understanding, emotional needs, or developmental challenges. It is important to approach behavioral issues with patience, empathy, and a focus on positive guidance.
