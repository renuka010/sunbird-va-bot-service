        > A TURTLE lived in a pond at the foot of a hill. Two young wild Geese, looking \nfor food, saw the Turtle, and talked with him. 
        The next day the G eese came \nagain to visit the Turtle and they became very well acquainted. Soon they were great friends.  \n\"Friend Turtle,\" the Geese said one day, \"we have a beautiful home far away. 
        We are going to fly back to it to- morrow. It will be a long but pleasant \njourney. Will you go with us?\" \n\"How could I? I have no wings,\" said the Turtle.  \n\"Oh, we will take you, if only you can keep your mouth shut, and say not a \nword to anybody,\" they said.  \n\"I can do that,\" said the Turtle. \"Do take me with you. I will do exactly as you wish.\"  \nSo the next day the Geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it. \"Now \ntake the middle of this in your mouth, and don't say a word until we reach \nhome,\" they said.  \nThe Geese then sprang into the air, with the Turtle between them, holding fast to the stick.  \nThe village children saw the two Geese flying along with the Turtle and cried \nout: \"Oh, see the Turtle up in the air! Look at the Geese carrying a Turtle by a stick! Did you ever see anything more ridiculous in your life!\" \nThe Turtle looked down and began to say, \"Well, and if my friends carry me, \nwhat business is that of yours?\" when he let go, and fell dead at the feet of \nthe children.  As the two Geese flew on, they heard the people say, when \nthey came to see the poor Turtle, \"That fellow could not keep his mouth \nshut. He had to talk, and so lost his life.
        
        > A KING once had a lake made in the courtyard for  the young princes to play \nin. They swam about in it, and sailed their boats and rafts on it. 
        One day the \nking told them he had asked the men to put some fishes into the lake.  \nOff the boys ran to see the fishes. Now, along with the fishes, there was a Turtle. 
        The boys were delighted with the fishes, but they had never seen a \nTurtle, and they were afraid of it, thinking it was a demon. They ran back to \ntheir father, crying, \"There is a demon on the bank of the lake.\" \nThe king ordered his men to catch the  demon, and to bring it to the palace. \nWhen the Turtle was brought in, the boys cried and ran away.  \nThe king was very fond of his sons, so he ordered the men who had brought \nthe Turtle to kill it.  \n\"How shall we kill it?\" they asked.  \n\"Pound it to powder,\" said some one. \"Bake it in hot coals,\" said another.  \nSo one plan after another was spoken of. Then an old man who had always \nbeen afraid of the water said: \"Throw the thing into the lake where it flows \nout over the rocks into the river. Then it will surely be killed.\" \nWhen the Turtle heard what the old man said, he thrust out his head and \nasked: \"Friend, what have I done that you should do such a dreadful thing as \nthat to me? The other plans were bad enough, but to throw me into the lake! Don't speak of such a cruel thing!\" \nWhen the king heard what the Turtle said, he told his men to take the Turtle \nat once and throw it into the lake. \nThe Turtle laughed to himself as he slid away down the river to his old home. \n\"Good!\" he said, \"those people do not know how safe I am in the water!
